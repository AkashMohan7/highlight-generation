Things I want this code to do:

- Take in a stream vod via a link
- Go through the stream and make notes of stretches of time where 
    - audio spikes
    - chat messages per second meets a certain threshold
- Turn these stretches of time into video clips
- Create a montage of these clips
Files Required:

- authentification file (DONE)
- file to take in a stream vod and download it
- file that will take in downloaded stream vod (use os) and check for 15-30 second stretches where audio spikes or messages meet a threshold
- file that will check for audio spikes and for increased chat messages
- file that runs everything and puts everything into one big montage
